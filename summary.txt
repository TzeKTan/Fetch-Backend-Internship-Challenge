1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
I chose Python because it is open source and has a lot of support and libraries that can be used for different applications.
It is also easy to understand and learn while being very flexible. The reason I chose Flask is because it is a lightweight
microframework, while providing all the necessary tools to build a REST API.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
Since Flask is a microframework, it is simpler to use to build a REST API. However, it doesnt have all the
features that a full framework like Django has. Other than that, Python has a lot of support and libraries that can be used
to support and enhance the API in the future.

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
My favorite project is probably the AirBnB Searcher me and some group mates built, as it taught me many new things such
as using Git, parsing CSV files, and utilizing different data structures to maintain quick search times.
